        <p>Paycrave is a mobile app designed to allow food truck fans to locate, review and purchase menu items from nearby food trucks. I started this project with extensive research followed by an iterative process of designing and redesigning based on usability testing. </p>

        <p>The first step was to find out what mobile apps already exist and are successful in the foodspace. I looked at direct competition (other food truck apps) as well as individual features from other apps related to food.</p>

        <div class= "sub-sect-init conclusion?">
          <h4>what does this mean for me?</h4>
          <p>Paycrave should be designed around fulfilling only one or two main uses. Other tasks should be designed as if they were convenient additional features. The aesthetic layout of the app should be simple, clear and unambiguously function-centered. Paycrave should also be designed to cultivate a continuing relationship with the user; it should retain information that makes each progressive use of the app easier and more enjoyable for the user. </p>

        <h2 id= "understanding-user">Understanding the User: User Surveys</h2>
        <p>The next step was to figure out who was likely to use a mobile app for food trucks, and what they would want to be able to use it for. I sent out a <a href= "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xqz3QyNLNvn0Mc8trJQUhNOiDJX7J-d6Q_63rhmbM5s/viewform">survey</a> to collect this information.</p>
        <img id= "data1" src= "img/proj-paycrave/user-survey.jpg">

        <h2 id= "analyzing-results">Analyzing Results and Forming a Vision</h2>
        <h4>who would use Paycrave?</h4>
        <p>The survey indicated that the most likely user of a mobile food-truck app were professionals between the ages of 25 - 50 who worked in a city and walk 15 minutes to grab lunch or dinner a couple times a week.</p>

        <h4 class= "sub-sect-init">how would they use Paycrave?</h4>

        <div class= "analyze-results row">

          </div>
          <div class= "small-12 large-4 columns">
            <p>The survey indicated that users would more commonly use a food-truck app for on-the-spot decision making than for planning for future meals even though the majority of people would use the app for both tasks at one point or another. Ability to discover and locate places to eat were valued significantly higher than the ability to order food. Quality of food, by far, was the most important determining factor when deciding where to eat. </p>

      <h4 class= "sub-sect-init">translating data into a product</h4>
      <p>My results tell me that users want an app that would allow them to locate nearby trucks and show them enough information (ratings, food type) upon first glance to choose trucks that sound appealing. One more click will show them reviews, a highlighted feature, and general information, and another click away shows them the menu list with prices. As a secondary feature, another couple clicks would allow the user to purchase food for pickup. While Paycrave allows the user to perform a multitude of other tasks and keeps a record of all activity, these capabilities are very slightly more embedded and do not obstruct the user flow. Paycrave is split into two sides. Its default side allows users to <strong>locate</strong> and <strong>discover</strong> nearby food trucks. The second half of the app is an editable record of all the user's account information and past activities. </p>
