          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Found Eats is a start-up ecommerce for specialty foods where small food makers can sell their products online to customers seeking artisanal foods. Food makers are directed to the vendor-facing side of the site where they must complete the set-up process to become an active seller on Found Eats. After the initial set-up is complete, vendor accounts will be used to manage orders, update products details and manage shipping and payment. This project is a redesign of the current Found Eats Vendor Account website.</p>  
        

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <ol class= "use-cases">
          <li><strong>I am a new vendor who is going through the set-up process the first time.</strong></li>
          <li>I am a vendor who is already up and live on the site, and am visiting the site to modify my information or products.</li>
          <li>I am a live vendor checking my account to maintain the orders that come in through the site.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>My redesign centers around fixing the problems created by <strong>Use Case #1</strong>. Ultimately the redesign creates more separation between the different use cases, clarifying both the set-up process and site management,  but because Found Eats is in its early stages, successfully signing on new vendors is the main priority. </p>


        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>My ultimate goal was to design a website that was intuitive, informative and made the user excited to complete the set-up process. My efforts were directed firstly at creating a clear trajectory of actions that a vendor must take before their account is complete. I want them to see how their progress reflects in the final product (their finished account on the customer-facing site).  and what they have left to do without making it seem like a daunting task.  Secondly, the changes are meant to clarify what information we are looking for. The overall effect should make the user feel more oriented in their location of the site and confident in an easy set-up process. The changes should also make vendors excited to complete the sign-up and become live on the site. </p>

        <h3>side-note: business objectives</h3>
        <p>The broad business objectives of my redesign are to increase profits and to reduce cost. This is achieved by reducing the number of problems occurring from the current design, further automating the vendor sign-up process and using the new website as an opportunity to implement a new shipping policy. The resulting product requires minimal maintenance allowing the company to handle a much larger influx of vendors, meanwhile reducing the staff budget. On the customer- facing marketplace, the changes to the vendor account website will increase the conversion rate of customers browsing through products to customers actively buying products on Found Eats, and will increase profits from individual sales.</p>

          <h2 class= "after-pic1">Understanding the User</h2>
          <p>The first step to designing a user-friendly site is to get to know the user. Significant amounts of time have been dedicated to talking to the user about their hopes for their companies and how they line up with the goals of Found Eats. Iâ€™ve aso invested many hours walking vendors through the set-up process, allowing me to observe closely how users interact with the website and how they hope to use it to present their company in a way that will accomplish their own goals. This process allowed me to identify what was causing the current problems, and what the user was really looking for, even if not explicitly stated.</p>
